Implementation of first and follow generator for compiler designing in python

# How to

write your rules in the [input_rules.txt](https://github.com/mehedi-shafi/First-and-Follow/blob/master/input_rules.txt)
  
  **you have to write the rule in following format**
  
  *S->Ab|0*
  
  > here '|' is for `or` and '0' defines `empty string` or `Ïµ`

run the [first_and_follow.py](https://github.com/mehedi-shafi/First-and-Follow/blob/master/first_n_follow.py) to run and show the first and follow in terminal.

`python first_and_follow.py`
